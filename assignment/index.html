        For question #4/#5, the showCollection function, I could not get my nested loop to work to display the song numbers for each track properly under the album/artist.  I ended up hardcoding numbers in and referencing them specifically, but feel it could be done better -- just can't wrap my head around how specifically.  Thanks!

        I also couldn't quite figure out all the logic for the Stretch Search Function, especially when getting to the object with more than one key search criteria.  Since it's a stretch goal, I won't bash my head against it too much, but it would be great to have some lessons to figure it out. :)
